    <h1>TiO-design <span class="wip">WIP 🚧</span></h1>
    <p>TiO is a community driven design System that allows brand to express their design in a unique, beautiful but
        also functional way. Get creative and dive into a rich set of cross platform components that let you model
        and
        prototype design interactions easily.</br>
        TiO is currently work in progress, however we are working hard to create the first set of components
        until mid 2019. <p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why do we need yet another design system?</h3>
        Don´t we already have Googles “Material Design”, Apples "Human Interface Guidlines" and Microsofts “Fluent
        Design"?</br>
        Yes, but they all lacking features in specific areas:</br>
    </p>

    <h4>One handed use</h4>
    <img src="images/reachable-area.png">

    <h4>Envoirmental interactions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>smart theme switching (brightness)</li>
        <li>particles (on button press)</li>
        <li>embrace the notch</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Customizability</h4>
    <h4>Expression of custom design/branding</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>looks of toolbar, fab and cards can be improved a lot</li>
        <li>inkwell is overused</li>
        <li>navigation is always in the same (bad) way (hamburger, go back in the top left corner, ...)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Open source and community driven 🗝</h4>
    </br>

    <!-- <li>Mostly optimized for just one platform</li>  -->

    <!--Roadmap:
    <ul>
        <li>Develop a basic design specification and concept (Feb 2019)</li>
        <li>Create design mockups for the first set of components (March 2019)</li>
        <li>Release a Flutter (maybe also AngularDart) implementation of the first set of components (Mai 2019)</li>
        <li>Become active on social media</li>
        <li>Create website</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to contribute?</h3>
    There is no way for you to contribute yet.</br>
    However we are working on a contribution system that should work like this:
    There are several ways how you can contribute to TiO:
    <ol>
        <li>Design concepts and specification</li>
        <li>Component design</li>
        <li>Component implementation</li>
    </ol>


    Besides the core, there are multiple GitHub repositories where every TiO components get developed.</br>
    In order to contribute to one
    of
    the
    parts you will first have to go on our website and start a new contribution. During the process you have to
    provide
    a short description of your contribution as well as your GitHub username so that we can grant you the necessary
    permissions. Then you will get a contribution id that is unique to your contribution. This contribution id will
    be
    used to identify the GitHub branches that belong to your contribution. After you´ve got the new contribution id
    you
    are ready to create a new branch in the repositories that you want to contribute to. The branch name should
    include
    the contribution id and a short description of your contribution (maybe we can automatically create the branch
    when
    the user requests a new contribution key on the website).-->
