    <h1>TiO-design</h1>
    <p>TiO is a community driven design System that allows brand to express their design in a unique, beautiful but
        also functional way. Get creative and dive into a rich set of cross platform components that let you model and
        prototype design interactions easily.</br>
        TiO is currently work in progress, however we are working hard to create the first set of components
        until mid 2019. <p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why do we need yet another design system?</h3>
        Don´t we already have Googles “Material Design”, Apples "Human Interface Guidlines" and Microsofts “Fluent
        Design"?</br>
        Yes but they all lacking in some specific areas:</br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>One handed use
            Insufficient support for branding:
            (touch feedback always looks the same -> inkwell)
            (people overusing cards since there is nothing else)</li>
        <li>Mostly optimized for just one platform</li>
        <li>Customizability</li>
        <li>Easy to integrate into existing apps (have some more fancy ideas here)</li>
        <li>And most importantly: They are not open source and not community driven</li>
    </ul>

    Roadmap:
    <ul>
        <li>Develop a basic design specification and concept (Feb 2019)</li>
        <li>Create design mockups for the first set of components (March 2019)</li>
        <li>Release a Flutter (maybe also AngularDart) implementation of the first set of components (Mai 2019)</li>
        <li>Become active on social media</li>
        <li>Create website</li>
    </ul>

    How to contribute?
    There is no way for you to contribute yet. However we are working on a contribution system that should work
    like
    this:
    There are several ways how you can contribute to TiO:
    1) Design concepts and specification
    2) Component design
    3) Component implementation

    There are multiple GitHub repositories where every TiO parts gets developed. In order to contribute to one of
    the
    parts you will first have to go on our website and start a new contribution. During the process you have to
    provide
    a short description of your contribution as well as your GitHub username so that we can grant you the necessary
    permissions. Then you will get a contribution id that is unique to your contribution. This contribution id will
    be
    used to identify the GitHub branches that belong to your contribution. After you´ve got the new contribution id
    you
    are ready to create a new branch in the repositories that you want to contribute to. The branch name should
    include
    the contribution id and a short description of your contribution (maybe we can automatically create the branch
    when
    the user requests a new contribution key on the website).
